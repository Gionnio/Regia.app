## ✨ Features
- **Smart Anchor Logic:** Recognizes the title based on the year or season, automatically removing useless tags (e.g., 1080p, H265, HEVC).
- **TMDB Integration:** Downloads accurate metadata (Official titles, Correct years).
- **TV Series Ready:** Automatic recognition of `SxxExx` and `Exxx` patterns.
- **Plex Friendly:** Option to move files into an ordered folder structure (`Series Name/Season X/Episode`).
- **Disambiguation:** Interface to manually choose the correct title in case of homonyms.
- **Undo:** Ability to undo the last rename/move operation.
- **Multi-language:** Native support for Italian 🇮🇹 and English 🇬🇧.
